Ideal Gas Bow Shock around a Cylinder solver (2D flow)
There are 2 solvers available:
* Hida's Method from An Approximate Study on the Detached Shock Wave in front of a Circular Cylinder and a Sphere (1953) https://doi.org/10.1143/jpsj.8.740 
* Sinclair and Cui's Method from A theoretical approximation of the shock standoff distance for supersonic flows around a circular cylinder (2017) https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4975983

There is also a dead branch containing an incomplete implementation of van Dyke's Method from The Supersonic Blunt-Body Problem - Review and Extension https://doi.org/10.2514/8.7744
